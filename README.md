When the user adds, deletes, or reverts a tag of the image, PhotoRenamer automatically writes a message to the local log file (PhotoRenamer.log).

In addition, when the user closes this application, it writes all the history, including tags and images that PhotoRenamer is keeping track of, to a serialized binary file. Next time when the application is launched, it will first read in previous binary file (if exists), and restore all the history information.
